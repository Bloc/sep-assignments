LINE
Q: How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?

A: The Line class wraps or holds a members array which sequentially orders the data.
Every element occupies a data locale within the array, which can be accessed and manipulated by
the included functions. New data can only be added to the end of the queue.

Q: If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for
 it?

A: Inspect the sorted array, via the #search method, to see if the data is present.

Q: What other real-world data can each structure represent?

A:  Team competition list, order of performers list, collection of books, product line, grocery list


PIXEL & SCREEN
Q: How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?

A: To create and place pixel data objects into the matrix use the insert method and include your
color specifications. RGB pixels are produced and are assigned to the corresponding variables. If
the RGB values are invalid default (highest or lowest possible) values are returned.Colors are
then inserted at the designated X,Y positions of the screen. Data points are found at the intersection
of the corresponding X and Y arrays.


Q: If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for
 it?

A: To access data at a given screen pixel you would use the #at method .

Q: What other real-world data can each structure represent?

A: This type of matrix could be used to make graphs, a chess game, a game of Xs and Os.

Create a function capable of printing the state of your HashClass to the console.

  Separate Chaining stats method output:
    Empty buckets are not printed.

    BUCKET AT INDEX 0:
      NODE 1: KEY is Star Wars: A New Hope, VALUE is Number Four

    BUCKET AT INDEX 2:
      NODE 1: KEY is Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, VALUE is Number One

    BUCKET AT INDEX 3:
      NODE 1: KEY is Star Wars: Attack of the Clones, VALUE is Number Two
      NODE 2: KEY is Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith, VALUE is Number Three

    This Hash has 8 BUCKETS and 4 NODES
    The current LOAD FACTOR is 0.5

  Open Addressing status method output:

    INDEX 0 = KEY: Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, VALUE: Number One
    INDEX 1 = KEY: Star Wars: Attack of the Clones, VALUE: Number Two
    INDEX 2 = KEY: Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith, VALUE: Number Three
    INDEX 3 = KEY: Star Wars: A New Hope, VALUE: Number Four
    INDEX 4 = KEY: Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, VALUE: Number Five
    INDEX 5 = KEY: Star Wars: Return of the Jedi, VALUE: Number Six
    INDEX 6 = KEY: Gobbledeegook, VALUE: Number Seven
    INDEX 7 = KEY: Young Anakin is dumb, VALUE: Number Eight
    INDEX 8 = KEY: Disney has devastaed the franchise..., VALUE: Number Nine
    INDEX 9 = KEY: Still going, VALUE: Number Ten
    INDEX 10 = KEY: Another One, VALUE: Number Eleven
    INDEX 11 = KEY: And again, VALUE: Number Twelve
    INDEX 12 = KEY: Childhood Ruined, VALUE: Number Thirteen

    The hash has 24 BUCKETS and 13 VALUES stored
    The LOAD FACTOR is 0.5416666666666666

Describe three collision resolution strategies not mentioned here.

* Coalesced hashing
    A hybrid of chaining and open addressing, coalesced hashing links
    together chains of nodes within the table itself. Like open addressing,it
    achieves space usage and (somewhat diminished) cache advantages over chaining.
    Like chaining, it does not exhibit clustering effects; in fact, the table can
    be efficiently filled to a high density. Unlike chaining, it cannot have more
    elements than table slots.

* Hopscotch hashing
    The hopscotch hashing algorithm works by defining a neighborhood of buckets
    near the original hashed bucket, where a given entry is always found. Thus,
    search is limited to the number of entries in this neighborhood, which is
    logarithmic in the worst case, constant on average, and with proper alignment
    of the neighborhood typically requires one cache miss.

* 2-choice hashing
    2-choice hashing employs two different hash functions, h1(x) and h2(x), for the
    hash table. Both hash functions are used to compute two table locations. When
    an object is inserted in the table, then it is placed in the table location that
    contains fewer objects (with the default being the h1(x) table location if there
    is equality in bucket size). 2-choice hashing employs the principle of the power
    of two choices.

Describe an analogy for relating an algorithm that has efficiency O(1) and another algorithm that has O(2n). An example would be:
    - An algorithm that has O(1) is a Cheetah and an algorithm that has O(2n) is a Snail.
** ANSWER:     
    - Another analogy might be the difference between a Prius (O(2n)) vs a Porsche (O(1))
    - And another analogy might be the difference between a moment in time (0(1)) vs an eternity (O(2n))..., as n approaches infinity.


In plain English, what is the best case scenario for binary search?  
** ANSWER: The first node is equal to item being searched for. Ω(1). 


In plain English, what is the worst-case scenario for binary search?  
** ANSWER: The last node is equal to item being searched for. O(n). 


In plain English, what is the bounded-case scenario for binary search? 
** ANSWER: The item being searched is not the first and not the last, but somewhere in between. Ө(log n).
